# VMM Demo Batch File - test.bat
# This demonstrates the Virtual Memory Manager functionality

# Turn on VMM verbose output to see what's happening
vmm

# Show initial VMM status
# (VMM status is automatically shown when verbose is turned on)

# Run some basic commands to allocate memory and see VMM in action
# Each command will allocate different amounts of memory (1-4 pages)
whoami
pwd
date
ls

# Run more commands to start filling up memory
who
ls -la
pwd
date

# Fill up even more memory to trigger page evictions
whoami
who
ls
pwd
date
whoami
ls -la

# Demonstrate the fillmem command which forces FIFO eviction
fillmem

# Run a few more commands to see VMM working after fillmem

# (This will be shown automatically since verbose is on)

# Commands will finish and clean up automatically
